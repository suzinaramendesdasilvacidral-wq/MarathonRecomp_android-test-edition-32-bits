# Marathon Recompiled for Android

Play the Xbox 360 version of *Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)* natively on a supported Android device.

This is an unofficial Android port of [Marathon Recompiled](https://github.com/sonicnext-dev/MarathonRecomp), modelled after [UnleashedRecomp-Android](https://github.com/SansNope/UnleashedRecomp-Android). It runs the game through static recompilation rather than emulating an Xbox 360, and includes an Android app, touch controls, gamepad support, a mod manager, and an optional custom Vulkan driver for Qualcomm Adreno GPUs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project does not include the game. You must supply files from your own legally acquired copy of *Sonic the Hedgehog (2006)* for Xbox 360.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an experimental community port. Performance and stability vary by phone, Android version, and GPU driver. Keep a copy of your saves and game files.

## What works

- The full game, including title screens and regular gameplay
- ARM64 Android devices (Android 9+)
- Installing the game and mods from a `.zip` or folder directly in the app — no PC needed
- Staging Xbox 360 base-game, title-update and DLC package files for verified installation on first launch
- On-screen touch controls with multi-touch, touch camera control, and a drag-to-arrange layout editor
- Bluetooth and USB controllers
- Sound through speakers, wired headphones, and Bluetooth devices
- HMM and UMM-style mods through the included manager
- Signed in-app updates from this repository's GitHub releases
- Optional bundled Turnip driver plus importing another driver as a plain `.so` or an AdrenoTools/ExynosTools package `.zip`
- Game-file access through Android's system Files app
- App UI in English and Russian
- Logs and hang diagnostics that can be shared without `adb`

The reference port targets Adreno 710, 725, 732 and 750 GPUs with bundled Turnip builds. **No driver binaries are committed to this repository** — drop community Turnip builds into `android-apk/app/src/main/assets/bundled_driver/` (names in `MarathonRecomp/os/android/vulkan_driver_android.cpp`) before building the APK. Without them the launcher falls back to the system Vulkan driver, and drivers can still be imported at runtime.

**Mali support is experimental**: recent Mali GPUs (Valhall generation and newer with a Vulkan 1.3 driver) run the game through the stock system driver; the app detects a non-Adreno GPU and skips the bundled Adreno driver automatically.

## Before you install

You need:

- A 64-bit Android device
- Android 9 or newer
- A supported Vulkan GPU (Adreno recommended)
- Several gigabytes of free storage
- Your own Xbox 360 game dump

For the smoothest first run, start with the default graphics settings. The Android build defaults to a 50% resolution scale, no anti-aliasing, 4× anisotropic filtering, and motion blur disabled.

## Installation

1. Download the latest APK from the repository's [Releases](https://github.com/Player124413/MarathonRecomp/releases) page (or from the workflow artifacts — note that GitHub artifact downloads are **zip files**: extract `app-debug.apk` from the zip first).
2. Allow your browser or file manager to install apps from unknown sources when Android asks.
3. Install and open **Marathon Recompiled**. The first launch creates the app's folders and prepares the bundled graphics driver.
4. Tap **Install game files (.zip / folder)** in the launcher and pick your game dump — either a ZIP archive or an extracted folder. The app finds the game inside the archive automatically and copies everything into place with a progress display. You can also choose **ISO / DLC packages**, select the base game and optional DLC files together, then launch once to verify and install them.
5. Tap **Launch game**.

### If the APK "doesn't install" (the dialog just disappears)

The debug APK from CI is signed with a debug key. A fresh GitHub runner generates
a new key on every run, so **an APK from run #2 cannot be installed over the APK
from run #1** (signature mismatch — the installer silently dismisses the dialog).
The workflow now caches the keystore, but if you already hit this:

- **Uninstall the old app first**, then install the new APK.
- Make sure the download finished and the file ends in `.apk` (GitHub artifacts
  are zips — extract `app-debug.apk`).
- Give your browser/file manager permission to install unknown apps
  (Settings → Apps → [browser] → Install unknown apps → Allow).
- Check the device: this APK is **arm64-v8a only**, Android 10+.
- For the exact error, use adb: `adb install -r app-debug.apk`.

No PC is required at any point.

## Building the APK with GitHub Actions (no local toolchain, no secrets)

The repository ships a workflow (`tools/ci/build-android-apk.yml`) that builds the
APK in the cloud fully automatically. You only need to provide the **game files**
through a public link:

1. Pack a zip containing the game files (any folder layout — they are found
   automatically):
   ```
   default.xex
   shader.arc
   shader_lt.arc
   ```
   (Optional: add `drivers/*.so` to bundle Turnip driver builds. Without them
   the app uses the system Vulkan driver.)
2. Upload the zip somewhere public — Google Drive or HuggingFace both work.
3. Run the **Build Android APK** workflow: in the repo, go to *Actions → Build Android APK → Run workflow* and paste the link into the `build_files_url` field. Alternatively set it once as the repository variable `BUILD_FILES_URL` (*Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables*).

Everything else is automatic:
- all git submodules are initialized by the workflow,
- **ffmpeg for Android is built from source** (7.1.1 + the XMA decoder patch)
  by `tools/ci/build_ffmpeg_android.sh` — no prebuilt ffmpeg zip needed,
- the host recompiler tools are built, `libmain.so` is cross-compiled with the
  NDK, the debug APK is assembled and uploaded as a workflow artifact
  (installable — signed with the Android debug key).

> **Note on the workflow location:** GitHub only auto-runs workflows from
> `.github/workflows/`. This copy is kept in `tools/ci/` so it can be versioned
> and pushed without extra repository permissions. To activate it, copy it to
> `.github/workflows/build-android-apk.yml` (GitHub UI: *Add file → Upload files*,
> or locally), then run it from the Actions tab.

No secrets, no keystore, no local Android SDK/NDK needed.

## Building the APK from source

### 1. Clone with submodules

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Player124413/MarathonRecomp.git
```

### 2. Add the required game files

Copy the following files from the game and place them inside `./MarathonRecompLib/private/`:
- `default.xex`
- `shader.arc`
- `shader_lt.arc`

`default.xex` is located in the game's root directory, while the others are located in `/xenon/archives`.

### 3. Build the host tools (once)

The recompiled code is generated at build time by tools that must run on the machine
you build on:

```bash
./build_host_tools.sh          # needs cmake + ninja + clang; uses ./thirdparty/vcpkg
```

### 4. Cross-compile the game (libmain.so)

```bash
export ANDROID_NDK_HOME=$HOME/Android/Sdk/ndk/29.0.14206865   # NDK r29
./build_android.sh            # -> out/build/android-arm64/MarathonRecomp/libmain.so
```

This uses the `android-release` CMake preset and the NDK toolchain. FFmpeg (used for
XMA audio decoding) is fetched from `sonicnext-dev/ffmpeg-core` releases; no Android
prebuilts are published upstream yet, so on the first run you must provide
`ffmpeg-android-arm64.zip` (built for arm64-android, same structure as the other
prebuilts) — place it at the path the configure step reports.

### 5. Assemble the APK

```bash
./build_apk.sh                # copies libmain.so into jniLibs, runs gradlew assembleDebug
```

Requires JDK 17 and the Android SDK (compileSdk 34). The debug APK lands at
`android-apk/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`.

### Optional: bundled drivers

Copy community Turnip driver builds into `android-apk/app/src/main/assets/bundled_driver/`
with the exact names from `MarathonRecomp/os/android/vulkan_driver_android.cpp`
(`vulkan.marathon_a732.so`, `vulkan.vauzi710_v2_7.so`, `vulkan.wb26_2_rp_pair_ccu_color_a725.so`)
before step 5 so they are packaged into the APK.

## Installing a custom Vulkan driver (Turnip)

The app imports a custom driver (e.g. a Mesa Turnip build) from **any** of these
folders — drop a plain `.so` (like `libvulkan_freedreno.so`) or an
AdrenoTools/ExynosTools package `.zip` into one of them and relaunch the game:

1. `Android/data/<app>/files/driver_import/` (launcher's **Driver folder** button)
2. `Android/media/<app>/driver_import/` (browsable by on-device file managers)
3. `<game root>/driver_import/` (next to your game files, opened via **Open game folder**)

Processed packages move to `installed/` and are selected automatically. See the
`readme.txt` written into each folder for TU_DEBUG / capture options.

> The debug APK must contain the libadrenotools hook libraries
> (`libmain_hook.so`, `libfile_redirect_hook.so`, `libgsl_alloc_hook.so`,
> `libhook_impl.so`) for driver loading to work — the CI workflow packages them
> next to `libmain.so` automatically. If the log shows
> `adrenotools hook missing from nativeLibraryDir`, the APK was built by an
> older workflow; rebuild with the current `tools/ci/build-android-apk.yml`.

## Configuration

- The launcher exposes the Vulkan driver, Turnip render mode, skip-intro and diagnostic options.
- In-game options (Input → touch controls/camera/stick, Video → resolution scale, driver, profiler) apply immediately or after restart as noted in-game.
- Touch-control layout is arranged from the launcher (**Controls → Arrange touch controls**).
- Mods are managed from the launcher (**Mods → Manage mods**), which writes the standard CPKREDIR/ModsDB.ini format.
